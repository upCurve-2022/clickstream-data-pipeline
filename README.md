The cleanse function performs various cleansing operations like modification of
column data types, removal of NULLs and duplicates and transformation (joins) to meet the
functional requirements.
Data quality checks are performed for schema validation, for null check within each record and
if duplicates are present.
Finally, the transformed data is written into mySQL table.
Visualization of processed data is then performed using tableau software.
